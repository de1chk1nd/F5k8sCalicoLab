Welcome to F5 k8s Lab Guide for Calico's documentation!
=======================================================

Welcome to my Lab Guide for integration F5 Container Ingress Services with k8s and Caclico as SNI.

This lab consist of 2 parts - one for setting up the SDN (to access the k8s pods) - and the second part to set up and test ingress services.

Please also check the Pre Work, as this includes Lab information and **important** information around k8s.

If you find any errors/mistakes or want to contribute to the overall quality of the lab, please send an email to *m.petersen@f5.com*
